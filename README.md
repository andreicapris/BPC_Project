# BPC_Project
 This was a project for the Basics of Programming course.\
It contains 10 vector programs, 10 array programs and a multifunctional application that were written as part of this course. \
The language is C but as we were required to use Visual Studio all the files are .cpp and this also explains the #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS at the beginning. \

I also tested them with ming-gw64 and the only change that is required is the main to not be declared void. \
All of the comments and input prompts are in Romanian. \
All of them will run in visual studio code with ming with the mention that the main should have the following int main(int argc, char **argv) and return 0 at the end. \
